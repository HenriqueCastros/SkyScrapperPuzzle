# Sky Scrapper Puzzle

<img src="https://www.puzzle-skyscrapers.com/art/og/puzzle-skyscrapers.png">

This is how I solved the Sky Scrapper Puzzle using C, using only malloc (Yes I know this may seem crazy ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚).

I developed this code at 42's Basecamp/Psicine. I hope you may find this interesting. Feel free to fork the repo or suggest improvements
